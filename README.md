✌🏿 Hi, Im Magret a Software Engineer based in Austin, Texas & Houston, Texas.

🤘🏿 I studied at The University of Texas with a focus on Computer Science, Black Studies, and Math (Class of 2024).

🏫  I will be attending Johns Hopkin University in 2025 (fall) to begin my Master of Computer Science with a concentration in Enterprise and Web Computing & Software Engineering. An subsequently another Master degree from Johns Hopkin University in Artificial Intelligence.                                                                                    

👩🏾‍💻 I have worked as a Software Developer, Front-End developer, Full stack developer, Data Engineer, and Web Developer. My experiences range from volunteer work to multiple internships.

💜 My aim is to give back to those who have been marginalized, those who lack the resources needed to attain an adequate education, and to enhance our everyday life. Check out some of my work in the Portfolio section. You should hire me!

📚Correspondingly, my Senior Seminar course helped me to explore the intersectionality of technology and health sciences within the context of the health and well-being of Black communities. In my research, I discovered that AI-based tools assessing crime are twice as likely to misclassify Black individuals as being at a higher risk of engaging in criminal activity compared to their White counterparts.

📚These issues arise from algorithms not understanding the historical and political factors that cause such disadvantage and disparity for marginalized populations who are subjected to these tools.

📚I firmly believe that addressing these negative aspects of AI is crucial, not to discredit the advancements made by AI, but rather to identify and improve any adverse effects. As scientists, we can work towards finding effective solutions and ensuring that AI continues to contribute positively to our society.
